# Win32 Numark PartyMix Driver written in Zig!

### Intro

Work in progress! At the moment, all I do is record inputs.

This is a library for keeping the state of my Numark PartyMix in a class, so I can use it for other projects.

##### Why?

I wanted to be able to use my Numark PartyMix as an input device for games, as an idea!

### Building

This only builds on windows, as it uses the Win32 api.

Build with `zig build`, but you may need to `zig fmt .`.
